## Moon-Browser

A browser implementation of the Moon Engine: an ultra-lightweight, formally verified kernel for decentralized applications (DApps). 

Note: this is repository is **not** the formally verified engine, but a lightweight (300kb minified) demo of the same DAppSpec in HTML5. The engine itself will be a native [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/) binary, and is planned to be released in 2018.
